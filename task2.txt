1.Document Object:

      *Represents the HTML document loaded in the browser.
      *Allows access to elements within the HTML page.
      *Used for adding dynamic content to web pages.
      *Accessed via window.document or simply document.

2.Commonly used properties include:

      *activeElement: Returns the currently active element.
      *body: Provides the contents of the <body> element.
      *URL: Gives the complete URL of the document.

3.Commonly used methods include:

       *addEventListener(): Attaches an event handler.
       *adoptNode(): Adopts a node from another document.
       *createAttribute(): Creates an attribute node.
       And more1.

Window Object:

       *Represents the browser window itself.
       *Encompasses properties, methods, and functionalities related to the browser environment.
       *Accessed via window.

Commonly used properties include:

      *screen: Provides information about the physical screen dimensions.
      *document: Refers to the rendered Document Object Model (DOM).
      *location: Contains information about the current URL.
